A crowdfunding platform is an online service that enables individuals, startups, organizations, or causes to raise funds from a large number of people, typically through small contributions. It provides a space where project creators can showcase their ideas, products, or initiatives, and supporters can contribute financially to help bring them to life. These platforms facilitate secure transactions, offer tools for campaign management, and often include features like progress tracking, reward systems, and community engagement.
Crowdfunding platforms are used for various purposes such as launching new products, funding creative projects, supporting charitable causes, or financing business ventures. They democratize fundraising by connecting creators with a global audience, reducing the barriers of traditional funding methods like loans or investor capital.
